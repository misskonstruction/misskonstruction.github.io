                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">and in past visits here it was refused.</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">New Port Richey is mostly trash though. Hate to say it. Reputation follows. My very own ex moved us here, of course. 
                                But something was different at Northbay this time. Actually everything was. The last few times I visited Trinity, my previous hospital of choice, 
                                I waited hours just to be seen, and was sent home pre-maturely twice. They nearly destroyed my heart not listening to me. 
                                So this time I decided whether or not they think i'm a tattooed weirdo only there for drugs, i was going to Northbay. With the 
                                confidence that once my vitals and bloodwork were done, they'd know i wasn't one of the many NPR pieces of shit, and that my treatment
                                 required narcotic pain relief. <br>      
                                And that is exactly what happened. I was in the ER waiting room for less than 10 minutes before being brought back for bloodwork, ecg and placed in a 
                                "fast track" ER room. They have a goal of getting patients in as quickly as possible, releasing those who can go to make room for those who need to stay. 
                                I didn't wait excessively for anything and they controlled my pain and nausea right away without being asked. The nurses were kind and supportive and the 
                                doctors were not assholes. My own gi doctor came to see me and i explained the issues i have with Dr Shah frowning on my going to the hospital but not referring 
                                me to specialists such as himself for treatment. That cycle has been hopefully broken. Dr Vangara is seeing me next month and i will continue to see him exclusively. 
                                <br>
                                By the time it was all said and done i was out of work for 10 days, the house went to shit, 2 of my plants nearly died and the girls marinated in tent shit for 
                                an entire week longer than they should be expected to. Dishes were done occasionally, laundry was not. Our bathroom was just as disgusting as i left it if not more so,
                                 because I'm the only one who cleans it. Just like i'm the only one who cleans the guinea habitat. I suppose they are technically mine, but we all love them. No one 
                                 plays with them but me so i guess that means i'm the clean up crew as well. They can help feed but not clean the subsequent shit that fills the tent to the point i 
                                 had to scoop it twice with the dustpan this morning. That's a lot of guinea shit. And it infuriated me. Should it have? I don't know. I have to watch my blood pressure. 
                                 Any time i feel i'm getting the short end of the stick i remember the life the kids and i crawled out of and decide whether it's really all that important, or should i 
                                 just sweep it under the rug and move on? (I do a lot of sweeping.)
                                <br>
                                But all of that aside, i'm glad i'm feeling better and i went back to work yesterday where i worked my entire shift for the first time in 2 weeks. When i tried to go back 
                                initially i had to leave for a couple hours and come back because the FEVER AND HIVES i got thanks to the flu shot they gave me on the last day had threatened to close my 
                                throat up and i couldn't talk to my customers. The second shift i tried i had to leave early because my chest produced a sudden pain right after a (non-descript) call that 
                                felt very much like i imagine a heart attack should. I clocked out immediately with barely a word to Matt, but later the pain subsided. Yesterday I achieved my full 10 hours. 
                                <br>
                                The worst part of the hospital stay was when i elected to have the flu shot they offered. I've had them before, not too recently but still, and never had a reaction. I wasn't 
                                aware i was allergic to any medications except possibly penicillin. They gave it to me on the day i was scheduled for discharge, which was a Wednesday, my goal being out by then
                                 so i could return to work on thursday. All my vitals and bloodwork was good, so they approved the discharge and gave me the flu shot. As i began getting ready to go, i started to 
                                 develop hives. They had to give me benadryl in my iv, and that seems to settle them all down and they began to disappear. So I went home. 
                                By the next morning my entire body was covered, mostly my legs and arms but my back, neck and stomach too. I also had high fever and shortness of breath. I almost feared having to go 
                                back to the ER but managed to wait it out with breathing treatments, more rest, lots of benadryl and aveeno rash lotion. It was positively awful and i will never get another flu shot. 
                                The hives are now gone but i still have tiny marks and itchy patches. If i never go through that again it will be too soon. These photos are graphic and disgusting to me so i felt the 
                                utter need to share them. I have never experienced anything like this in my life. Like i said, they are gone now, but some residual effects are still there. It was traumatic to say the least.
