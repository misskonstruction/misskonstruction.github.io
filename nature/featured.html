        <p class="lead">  If we have a cold heart towards a servant or a friend, why should we wonder if we have no fervor towards God? If we are cold in our private prayers, we should be earthly and dull in the most devout religious order; if we cannot bear the vexations of a companion, how should we bear the contradiction of sinners? if a little pain overcomes us, how could we endure a cross? if we have no tender, cheerful, affectionate love to those with whom our daily hours are spent, how should we feel the pulse and ardor of love to the unknown and the evil, the ungrateful and repulsive?

            Do everything for God, uniting yourself to Him by a mere upward glance, or by the overflowing of your heart towards Him. 
            Never be in a hurry; do everything quietly and in a calm spirit. Do not lose your inward peace for anything whatsoever, 
            even if your whole world seems upset. Commend all to God, and then lie still and be at rest in His bosom. Whatever happens, 
            abide steadfast in a determination to cling simply to God, trusting to His eternal love for you; and if you find that you have 
            wandered forth from this shelter, recall your heart quietly and simply. Maintain a holy simplicity of mind, and do not smother

            She abandoned her whole self to the Lord, with all that she was and all that she had; and, believing that He took that which

            always anti–self-realisation. His purpose is not the development of a man; His purpose is to make a man exactly like Himself, and the characteristic of the Son of God is self-expenditure. If we believe in Jesus, 
            it is not what we gain, but what He pours through us that counts. It is not that God makes us beautifully rounded grapes, but that He squeezes the sweetness out of us. Spiritually, we cannot measure our life by success,

            When Mary of Bethany broke the box of precious ointment and poured it on Jesus’ head, it was an act for which no one else saw any occasion; the disciples said it was a waste. But Jesus commended Mary for her extravagant 
            act of devotion, and said that wherever His gospel was preached “this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.” Our Lord is carried beyond Himself with joy when He sees any of us doing what Mary did, 
            not being set on this or that economy, but being abandoned to Him. God spilt the life of His Son that the world might be saved; are we prepared to spill out our lives for Him? “He that believeth on Me,” out of him, “shall flow 
            rivers of living water,” that is, hundreds of other lives will be continually refreshed. It is time now to break the life, to cease craving for satisfaction, and to spill the thing out. Our Lord is asking who of us will do it for Him?<br>

          <p class="lead">  I wonder if that is God’s voice?” Isaiah said that the Lord spake to him “with a strong hand,” that is, by the pressure of circumstances. Nothing touches our lives but 
            it is God Himself speaking. Do we discern His hand or only mere occurrence? Get into the habit of saying, “Speak, Lord,” and life will become a romance. Every time circumstances press, 
            say, “Speak, Lord”; make time to listen. Chastening is more than a means of discipline, it is meant to get me to the place of saying, “Speak, Lord.” Recall the time when God did speak 
            to you. Have you forgotten what He said? As we listen, our ear gets acute, and, like Jesus, we shall hear God all the time.<br>
